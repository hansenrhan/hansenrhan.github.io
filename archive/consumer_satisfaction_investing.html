        <h4>Customer Satisfaction Data: A Winning Stock Market Strategy?</h4>
        <p class="card-text"><small><i>A deep dive into the American Consumer Satisfaction Index as a potential indicator for outperforming the S&P 500.</i></small></p>
        <br>      
        <main>
          <h6><u>Introduction</u></h6>
          <p>
              The American Consumer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) has previously gained attention as a potential tool for beating the S&P 500, with numerous articles, including ones in the Harvard Business Review, advocating its effectiveness. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) was launched based on ACSI scores, but it has since underperformed the S&P 500 (past 5-year return of 37.94% and 51.70%, respectively). This article delves deeper into the relationship between consumer satisfaction data and stock market performance, exploring various strategies and scenarios to determine if the ACSI can genuinely be employed to outperform the stock market.

          <h6><u>Stock Prices of ACSI Companies and S&P 500 Companies</u></h6>
          <p>
              To establish a baseline for comparison, we first analyzed the performance of 202 publicly traded companies with ACSI data against the S&P 500 from 1996 to 2021. Our analysis showed that neither strategy substantially outperformed the other year after year, with both strategies having higher returns than the other 50% of the time. This finding indicates that the companies surveyed in the ACSI overall had a similar performance to the S&P 500.

          <h6><u>Investing Strategy 1: Each Year, Pick the Highest Satisfaction Companies</u></h6>
          <p>
              We further analyzed whether a strategy that picked companies in the top (or lowest) 1%, 5%, 10%, or 25% percentile in terms of consumer satisfaction would perform significantly better (or worse) than the S&P 500. The results showed that neither the top 1% nor the bottom 1% companies consistently outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, the bottom 10% of companies had the highest performing strategy for 12 of the 26 years, while the top 10% and 25% of companies did not outperform the S&P 500 consistently. This finding suggests that the correlation between high consumer satisfaction and stock market performance is not as straightforward as it may initially appear.

          <h6><u>Investing Strategy 2: Each Year, Pick the Highest Satisfaction Company for Each Sector</u></h6>
          <p>
            Lastly, we examined how well a strategy that picked the top company in each sector would perform. Even if a sector as a whole had much lower satisfaction rates than other, we would still pick the top company for that sector. This strategy yielded a substantial return of 1217.44%, and individually outperformed the S&P 500 for 17 of the 26 years (65.4%). In contrast, the worst company in each sector outperformed the S&P 500 in 4 of the 26 years, indicating that this strategy might have some merits, but it does not guarantee consistent outperformance.

          <p>The strategy of picking companies with satisfaction scores in the 99th percentile across all sectors had the highest overall returns, but picking the top company in each sector seemed to be a more robust strategy that still beat the S&P 500 given that it beat the S&P 500 annually for the majority of years.</p>

          <h6><u>Conclusion & Key Takeaways</u></h6>
          <p>
              <ul>
                <li>An investment strategy that annually selected companies in the 99th percentile for consumer satisfaction overall yielded higher results than the S&P 500 cumulative over 26 years.</li>
                <li>However, selecting the top company in each sector seems to be preferable despite lower returns than picking the 99th percentile across all sectors (1,217.44% vs. 3,607.41%) since the majority (65.4%) of years tested</li>
              </ul>
